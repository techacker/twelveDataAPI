Using twelveData API with Google Scripts

During my research to get Stock market and Crypto currencies data, I stumbled upon http://twelvedata.com and its API.
I wanted to use it in my person project with Google Sheets.

These are the steps I followed and anyone who wants to use their API should follow as well:

    1. Visit TwelveData at http://twelvedata.com
    2. Sign-up for an account.
    3. Verify your email and select a plan. (Free for personal use with limitations.)
    4. Get an API Key. This is required for any feed you would like to get from their API.
    5. If you like, reference the shared Google Sheet - http://tchkr.us/2Z0JSU4 and modify as needed by making a copy of it.
    6. Use or Fork the code for your personal projects.
    7. If you come up with something great and have suggestions for improvement to this project. Please push the changes so we all benefit from it.


DISCLAIMER:
    * I have no affiliation with TwelveData and I am not receiving any form of compensation from them to promote their API.
    * I created this code for my personal use and thought of sharing with whoever would like to use their API. They also have very good how-to guides and have far more information and customization options that may be more suited for your needs.


Thank you!
